# Py2DSpectroscopy

Py2DSpectroscopy is a light weight Python UI code for the analysis of two-dimensional spectroscopy data. It was designed to analyze photoluminescence maps of two-dimensional materials such as MoS_2. 

## Features

* load and browse two-dimensional spectroscopy data
* remove background from the data
* remove cosmic rays from the data
* align microscope images (e.g. AFM or SEM) with the data
* fit the data
